## Overview

The type of Crossy Road game is where players can navigate a character through various horizontally crossing cars. The game includes a scoring and coins collecting system where the difficulty level will adjust automatically according to the scores earned, which includes an increase in the speed of the cars.



## Game instruction

Once the program is started, click the "start" button to start the game.

In the game, the player controls a character who must cross a busy road filled with moving vehicles. The game's objective is to advance as far as possible without getting hit by cars while collecting coins. Players are allowed to use ↑ ↓ → ← to make movements.

If the player is hit by a car, the game will jump to the game over screen and they will have the choice of either replay or exit the game.



## Cheat mode

To quickly showcase the end screen, just simply get hit by a car, and the game over screen will display.
